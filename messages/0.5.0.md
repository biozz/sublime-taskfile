## v0.5.0 - 2021-07-05

I had to rewrite the plugin to support Python 3.3, because there are some issues (https://github.com/wbond/package_control/issues/1570#issue-900010126) with loading Python 3.8 modules.

The previous work lives at `python38` branch and will be braught back once the issue is resolved.
