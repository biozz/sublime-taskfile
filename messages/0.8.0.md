## v0.8.0 - 2022-09-30

The release started as a minor one to add support for includes (#4). But ended up as quite a big one, because recent releases of Taskfile added features, which allowed removal of `pyyaml` dependency and bumping internal python version to `3.8`.

Here goes a proper list of changes:

- add support for includes by utilizing `--list-all` flag (#4)
- remove `pyyaml` dependency
- bump internal python version to `3.8`
- bump dev dependencies
- update README regarding python version, features and installation
